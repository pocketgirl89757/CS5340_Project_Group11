 With Bayesian Network being one of the most intuitive and prevalent models for uncertainty modeling, it has been widely used to solve problems in various domains, such as medical decision-making and disaster management. As millions of world citizens are suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic nowadays, the mortality risk of each individual dying from the disease varies from one to another. This project uses a Bayesian Network approach to study the risk of a COVID-19 patient. The primary solution is a Naïve Bayes approach to model mortality risk with respect to a patient's demographics factors, existing conditions and symptoms. To evaluate the performance of this solution, a more complicated Bayesian model is constructed as a benchmark model, where the inter-relationships of demographics factors and existing conditions are considered. The evaluation result demonstrates that the Naïve Bayes model combined with MAP and MLE technique is able to achieve a comparable performance in predicting the mortality risk of a COVID-19 patient. Moreover, the Naïve Bayes model provides not only a convenient tool to access the mortality risk of COVID-19 patients, but also a strong motivation for developing more advanced Bayesian Network model in the future.
